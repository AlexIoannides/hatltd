# Getting Started with Unity

What we have learnt.

## What is Unity?

Unity is a tool that translates the coding language C# into easy to use functions that are used to create projects, those projects are coded with the translated funcions as well as scripts like movement coded by a person in C#.

## How do you build game worlds?

Unity comes with usefull assets and world templates ( 3D or 2D) that you can use combined with entitys to create games.

## How do you make things come alive in the game world?

Unity comes with basic animations for 2d and 3d models, but it is possible to create your own animations plus textures (makes thing look like things eg: brick texture would be used on an entity you wish to be a brick structure)

## What is version control and why is it useful?

Version controll allows you to save all versions of your work, meaning if you encounter a bug, you simply roll back to an earlier version eg:  Let's say we are making a game and V1.2.7 has a bug that you are struggling to fix, you can just go back to V1.2.6 or an even earlier version that does not have that bug.
